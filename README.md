# Cancer Health Informatics using Web Mining and NLP

## Topic Link:https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cancer Health Informatics project, where we harness the power of web mining and natural language processing (NLP) to delve into cancer-related topics sourced from the National Cancer Institute website. This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets that demonstrate various analyses and visualizations performed on the extracted text. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into cancer-related content, ranging from article summarization and sentiment analysis to identifying common words, named entities, keywords, and even clustering articles based on their content.

## Article Summarization
Generate a concise summary of a cancer-related article.

## Sentiment Analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on cancer-related articles to understand the emotional tone.

## Most Common Words
Find the most common words used in cancer-related content.

## Word Cloud Visualization
Create a word cloud visualization of common words in cancer-related content.

## Named Entity Recognition
Identify and extract named entities (e.g., cancer types, drugs) from the content.

## Keyword Extraction
Extract keywords or phrases that are most relevant to the cancer-related content.

## Article Clustering
Cluster similar cancer-related articles based on their content.

## Document Similarity
Calculate the similarity between two cancer-related articles.


### Feel free to explore and adapt these code snippets to your specific needs and data. This README serves as a guide to understanding the functionalities of the Cancer Health Informatics project and how each code snippet contributes to the analysis of cancer-related content from the National Cancer Institute website.

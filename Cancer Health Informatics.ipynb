    "## Project Description: \n",
    "In this project for module 7, we will leverage web mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze cancer-related topics from the National Cancer Institute website. We will focus on article summarization, sentiment analysis, and text analysis to gain insights into the most common words and ideas used in cancer-related content. We will use Python and Jupyter Notebook for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every question that requires you to write code will have a code cell underneath it; you may either write your entire solution in that cell or write it in a python file (`.py`), then import and run the appropriate code to answer the question.\n",

    "Use the following link to help execute the coding by answering the questions: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/6/new-trials-show-increased-survival-rates-for-a-range-of-cancers \n",

    "This assignment requires that you write additional files; make sure to submit those files in your repository as well."

      "At the annual event, which wraps up on Tuesday, doctors and researchers revealed several studies that showed increased survival rates for people living with serious stages of the disease, including for lung and brain cancer.\n",
      "Developed by the pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca, the daily pill targets patients with non-small cell cancer – by far the most common type – as well as a mutation of their epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR.\n",
      "Iris Pauporte, head of research at France’s League Against Cancer, told AFP news agency the advance was a “big ray of hope” for treating non-small cell lung cancer, for which progress has been slow.\n",
      "Another treatment, called vorasidenib, was found to significantly prolong the progression-free survival of patients with brain tumour glioma, according to clinical trial results.\n",

      "Preliminary trial results also released in Chicago indicated the drug ribociclib reduced the risk of breast cancer recurring by 25 percent for a large group of early-stage survivors.\n",
      "A trial also presented at ASCO showed that taking the antibody treatment mirvetuximab soravtansine significantly improved the survival rate of patients with ovarian cancer, a particularly deadly form of cancer.\n",

    "- Sentiment polarity suggests a slightly positive sentiment. It means that the overall tone of the news article is leaning towards being positive.\n",

    "- The positive sentiment polarity suggests that the article's content is likely discussing positive developments or advancements in cancer treatment. The subjectivity score indicates that the article may not only provide factual information about the trial results but could also have some subjective elements, such as opinions from medical experts, patients, or researchers regarding the significance of these findings.\n",

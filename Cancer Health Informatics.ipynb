    "## Project Description: \n",
    "In this project for module 7, we will leverage web mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze cancer-related topics from the National Cancer Institute website. We will focus on article summarization, sentiment analysis, and text analysis to gain insights into the most common words and ideas used in cancer-related content. We will use Python and Jupyter Notebook for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every question that requires you to write code will have a code cell underneath it; you may either write your entire solution in that cell or write it in a python file (`.py`), then import and run the appropriate code to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following link to help execute the coding by answering the questions: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment requires that you write additional files; make sure to submit those files in your repository as well."
